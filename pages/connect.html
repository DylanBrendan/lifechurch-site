<!--
What will you send me?
We’ll only send you things to help you grow in your relationship with Christ: notes from the series, exclusive videos, and more. Plus, you’ll get a chance to win some free gifts, too! But we won’t send you one thing: spam.
Tell me more about the show.
We’ll be here week after week with another message sharing the love of Christ. There’s no catch. We believe it’s more blessed to give than receive, so we are here to give to you. That’s it.
Who is LifeChurch.tv?
We are one church in multiple locations and online. Our mission is to lead people to become fully devoted followers of Christ. Learn more about LifeChurch.tv and our beliefs.
