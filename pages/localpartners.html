      <p>We believe the local church is the hope of our communities, which is why we are committed to providing relief and restoration to our communities through partnerships with local organizations. After all, we can do infinitely more together than we can apart.</p>

      <h2>How Local Partnership Works</h2>
    </header>
    <article>
      <p>The process of becoming a LifeChurch.tv local missions partner begins with a conversation between the organization and the LifeGroups and Mission Pastor at a LifeChurch.tv campus to discuss potential service opportunities and then continues when the partner completes an official application to become a LifeChurch.tv partner.</p>

      <p>We will review the prospective partnership to ensure the volunteer roles are restorative and clearly defined, and then evaluate the organization’s standing to ensure we can grant funding. If the partnership is approved, a one-year agreement is signed and LifeChurch.tv gives a grant to the partner organization. We renew partnerships annually.</p>

      <p>Throughout the year, the partner and campus team work together to recruit individuals to become involved with the partner organization. The partner provides training, guidance, and support to each volunteer. We want to help our partners be effective, so we share feedback that we receive through volunteer surveys about their experience.</p>

      <p>Learn more about our approach to local missions by reading our Missions Principles and watching Restore, a three-session video series that guides individuals to identify, evaluate, and commit to what God has called them to do in their communities.</p>

        <h3>How Funding Works</h3>
        <p class="detail">In the first year of partnership, we will provide a $5,000 grant to the organization. 
        At the beginning of the second year, the partnership will be renewed if the partner meets all expectations during year one. If the partner reports at least 30 volunteers engaged on two or more of the quarterly reports during year one, we will provide a $12,000 grant to the organization. If the partner reports at least 75 volunteers engaged, we will provide a $30,000 grant to the organization.</p>
        <p class="detail">When the partnership is renewed in year three and beyond, if the partner reports at least 30 volunteers engaged on three or more of the quarterly reports during the previous year, we will provide a $12,000 grant to the organization. If the partner reports at least 75 volunteers engaged, we will provide a $30,000 grant to the organization.</p>
        <p class="detail">Grants will not be restricted to a specific project. However, the funding is intended to be used by the organization to accomplish its stated mission.</p>
