2. Some confront **unlovingly**.

### Prayerful confrontation

1. God, help me confront with the goal of **restoration**.
2. God, help me confront with **caution**.

* Share a time when you confronted another person. How did you do it and what resulted from it?
* What obstacles might be standing in your way of taking a more prayerful approach when confronting others?
* Share a time when someone confronted you. How did they confront you, and did the way they confront you help or hurt you?
